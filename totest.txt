TODO:
-Write checking after tag closing that all ofx mandatory structures are present
-Write currency conversion routine inside transaction lists
-Stock and investment account support.  This is not trivial
-OFX export

UNIMPLEMENTED:
-In <BANKACCTFROM>, the field <ACCTKEY>, some sort of checksum.  See spec 1.6, p. 179.
I dont know how to use it.  This fiels represents "Check digits" in Belgium, D.C. in Spain,
