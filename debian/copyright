  A royalty-free, worldwide, and perpetual license is hereby granted to
  any party to use the Open Financial Exchange Specification to make, use,
  and sell products and services that conform to this Specification.

  THIS OPEN FINANCIAL EXCHANGE SPECIFICATION IS MADE AVAILABLE "AS IS"
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW, MICROSOFT, INTUIT AND CHECKFREE ("PUBLISHERS") FURTHER
  DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
  NONINFRINGEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. THE ENTIRE RISK
  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SPECIFICATION REMAINS WITH RECIPIENT. TO
  THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
  PUBLISHERS OF THIS SPECIFICATION BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES
  WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
  PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER
  PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF ANY USE TO WHICH THIS SPECIFICATION IS
  PUT, EVEN IF THE PUBLISHERS HEREOF HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
  OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Further clarification of these terms from the OFX Foundation says that
the restriction which appears to only allow things which "conform to
this Specification" means specifically that if an implementation
claims to conform to OFX but does not then there is a problem, but
otherwise there is none:

  As long as your software doesn't state that it uses OFX (i.e. doesn't
  mention what it uses), then all should be fine.

  The bottom line seems to be that it is fine if you use OFX technology as
  long as you do not represent your own enhanced version (added to or
  changed) as official "OFX".

  Your software need not implement the whole DTD.

This thus permits the distribution of modifications (a key question),
provided that there is no inaccurate claim made about OFX compliance.
